      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      Hi, I’m Nicholas! I’m a Full-Stack web developer based in Vancouver, BC. <br/>
      I’m passionate about writing functional and efficient code that creates an intuitive user experience. <br/>
      On top of building web apps, I also love to build PCs for others. 
      <br/> Having grown up in Hong Kong and studied at an international school for 12 years, and 5 years here in Vancouver, 
      <br/> I've been heavily exposed to both western and eastern cultures, which is why I speak 3 languages (English, Cantonese, Mandarin) 
      <br/> and am adaptable and welcoming to experience different cultures and connect with people of different backgrounds.
