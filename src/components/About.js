      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Nicholas! I’m a Full-Stack web developer based in Vancouver, BC. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about writing functional and efficient code that creates an intuitive user experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of building web apps, I also love to build PCs for others. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Having grown up in Hong Kong and studied at an international school for 12 years, and 5 years here in Vancouver, 
        I've been heavily exposed to both western and eastern cultures,  
        which is why I speak 3 languages (English, Cantonese, Mandarin)
        and am adaptable and welcoming to experience different cultures and connect with people of different backgrounds.
